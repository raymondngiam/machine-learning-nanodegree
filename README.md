## Software Requirements

These projects use the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

If you already have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, then you can install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as 'iPython') by using pip on the command line. This page may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, you can install all the packages with the following command:
```
sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```
