## Software Requirements

These projects use the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

If you already have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, then you can install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as 'iPython') by using pip on the command line. This page may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, you can install all the packages with the following command:
```
sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

**P0: Titanic Survival Exploration**
  - Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Started with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

**P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices**
  - Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

**P2: Build a Student Intervention System**
  - Investigated the factors that affect a student's performance in high school. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on a given dataset to predict how likely a student is to pass. Selected the best model based on relative accuracy and efficiency.

**P3: Creating Customer Segments**
  - Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

**P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive**
  - Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

**P5: Capstone Project**
  - More details coming soon.
